I’ve been trying to figure out if there are any sources with more recent updates on H1B visas processing details, as I have reasons to believe that the official USCIS page provides a bit outdated information. 
I’ve came across a page that seems to have something I’ve been looking for (not sure how legit it is, though). 
Anyways, since I’ve got a some time and some inspiration, I put this simple script together in order to mine some data from the resource mentioned above.
